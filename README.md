# Sentiment-Analysis-Reviews

Sentiment Analysis: Here I go through some data exploration, and manipulation to build up a database that contains some paramenters for Sentiment Analysis. Using a quick NaiveBayesClassifier I build a score for each word that can be used to rank results (indipendently form their review scores)

Create some useful function to play with words: I define some handy functions, some choices have been made for making them a bit faster (like using Toktok) as we will have to run this over the whole database.

Finally, lets have some fun reading the top 3 worst reviews!
